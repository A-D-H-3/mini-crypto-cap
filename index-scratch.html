            Peter Griffin: Do you have any past injuries, physical anomalies?
            Peter Griffin: Well, I didn't have gas for the first time 'til I was
            30. [flashback to Peter in the 1970s, sitting on a beanbag reading]
            Peter Griffin: [farting noise] Peter Griffin: What the hell was
            that? Brian Griffin: Want to go get an ice cream? Will that make you
            feel better? [Stewie shakes his head] Brian Griffin: Want to get
            some McDonald's? [Stewie shakes his head] Brian Griffin: Want to go
            take a dump in Mother Maggie's shoes? [Stewie nods] Brian Griffin:
            All right, let's take a dump in Mother Maggie's shoes. Adam West:
            Damnit, Swanson, I want them found! Joe Swanson: Mayor West, we have
            every available man looking for the Griffins, we just don't have any
            leads. Adam West: Not the Griffins, you moron! The rest of my Lite
            Brite pieces! My name isn't "Adam We"... or is it? Who am I? What
            number did you call? Don't ever call here again. [he hangs up the
            phone] Adam West: I guess I told him! Nobody messes with Adam We!
            Cleveland: You can stay with us, Meg, I just hope you don't mind
            that my uncle died in the guest bedroom. Meg Griffin: I guess that's
            OK. When did he die? [opens the bedroom, a dead body is lying on the
            bed] Cleveland: We think it was some time between the Tonight Show
            and the Today Show. Brian Griffin: The sixties brought the hippie
            breed / And decades later, things have changed indeed / We lost the
            values, but we kept the weed / You've got a lot to see / The Reagan
            years have laid the frame / For movie stars to play the White House
            game / We're not to far from voting Feldman-Haim / You've got a lot
            to see / The town of Vegas / Has got a different face / 'Cause it's
            a family place / With lots to do / Where in the fifties / A man
            could mingle with scores / Of all the seediest whores / Well now his
            children can too / You heard it from the canine's mouth / The
            country's changed, that is except the South / And you'll agree / No
            one really knows, my dear lady friend / Just quite how it all will
            end / So hurry, 'cause you've got a lot to see / The baldness gene
            was cause for dread / But that's a fear that you can put to bed /
            They'll shave your ass and glue it on your head / You've got a lot
            to see / The PC age has moved the bar / A word like "redneck" is a
            step too far / The proper term is "country music star" / You've got
            a lot to see / Our flashy cell phones / Make people mumble, "Gee
            whiz" / "Look how important he is" / "His life must rule" / You'll
            get a tumor / But on your surgery day / The doc will see it and say
            / "Wow, you must really be cool" / Tom Tucker: There's lots of
            things you may have missed! Adam West: Like Pee-Wee and his famous
            wrist! Cleveland: Or Sandy Duncan's creepy phony eye! Neil Goldman:
            That awesome "Thundercats" cartoon! Diane Simmons: Neil Armstrong
            landing on the moon! Meg Griffin: Neil Armstrong? Wait, was he the
            trumpet guy? Brian Griffin: So let's go see the USA / They'll treat
            you right, unless you're black or gay / Or Cherokee / But you can
            forgive he world and its flaws / And follow me there, because /
            You've still got a hell of a lot to see / You've got a lot to see /
